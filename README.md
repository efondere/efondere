# About me
**Hello there, I'm Eliot!**

I'm the current electical and embedded team lead at [Exocet](https://github.com/Exocet-Polytechnique), a university team building a hydrogen-powered boat. I work on designing electrical circuits for our power system and PCBs using KiCad. I now have over 11 years of experience in robotics and have been programming in C++ for more than 7 years as well. I have also been programming in Rust (my new favorite language!) for about 2 years.

Otherwise, I've learned about computer graphics using Vulkan and OpenGL. I recently re-discovered an old project of mine ([WorldViewer](https://github.com/efondere/WorldViewer) - boring name, I know...) with which I rendered my current banner. I'm interested in all the beautiful things we can do with math!

# Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
- [squash](https://github.com/efondere/squash): a (very inefficient) image compression algorithm based on JPEG and Haar wavelets
- [exo-pcbs](https://github.com/Exocet-Polytechnique/exo-pcbs): a collection of PCBs that make a hydrogen boat work!
- [exo-electical](https://github.com/Exocet-Polytechnique/exo-electrical): the electrical ~~mess~~ circuits of Exocet's boat
