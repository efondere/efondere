# About me
**Hello there, I'm Eliot!**

I have a strong interest for systems programming and a deep hate for python's OOP syntax. More seriously, I've been doing robotics for over 10 years 🤖 and still very much like it. I have experience with C++, but I'm currently learning Rust and slowly wondering if it could be great for robot programming! Otherwise, I enjoy creating (and playing) video games 🎮.

I hope you can find something that interests you here, or perhaps over at my (currently empty) [blog 🔍](https://www.eliotfondere.com/blog).

# Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
- [ArduinoExtra](https://github.com/Vanier-Robotics/ArduinoExtra): a liteweight implementation of the C++ standard library's `vector` and `function` classes
- [DreamWalker](https://github.com/efondere/Dream-Walker): my biggest game so far, which was born from a game jam
- [squash](https://github.com/efondere/squash): a very inefficient image compression algorithm based on JPEG and Haar wavelets
